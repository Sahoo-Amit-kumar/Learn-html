        <li>Cultural Significance – Odisha celebrates “Pakhala Dibasa” (Pakhala Day) on 20th March every year, highlighting the dish’s importance in Odia culture and daily life.</li>
        <li>Nutritious & Refreshing – Fermented rice in Pakhala is rich in probiotics, aiding digestion and boosting gut health, while also being light and refreshing.</li>
        <li>Really it's just like a elixir for Odias</li>

        <li>Special Festival Dish – Enduri Pitha is especially prepared during Prathamastami, a festival in Odisha that celebrates the well-being of the eldest child in the family.</li>
        <li>Unique Turmeric Leaf Steaming – The pitha is made by steaming rice flour batter filled with coconut and jaggery stuffing inside turmeric leaves, which give it a distinct aroma and flavor.</li>
        <li>Healthy & Nutritious – Since it is steamed (not fried) and uses natural ingredients like rice, coconut, jaggery, and black gram, Enduri Pitha is both delicious and easy to digest.</li>

        <li>Cultural Pride – Often called the “Pride of Odisha”, Chhena Poda is offered in temples and is an essential part of Odia festivals and celebrations.</li>
        <li>Accidental Invention – Chhena Poda, meaning “roasted cottage cheese”, was accidentally created when leftover sweetened chhena (cottage cheese) was left in a hearth overnight and baked.</li>
        <li>Unique Flavor – It is the only Indian sweet that is baked; the caramelized sugar gives it a distinct smoky-sweet taste.</li>
